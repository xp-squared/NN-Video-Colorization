Neural network to colorize and use style transfer on grayscale images

To-Do List:
1. Download and prepare the dataset : DONE
2. Write code for extracting frames : DONE  <br>
3. turn frames grayscale and resize images : DONE <br>
4. Organize dataset with training, validation, and testing sets with: DONE
5. Build CNN model with pytorch : 
6. Train CNN model with grayscale frames and compare with the original ground truth from these videos : 
7. Reassemble colored frames into a video : 
8. Attemp creating another NN for style transfer : 
9. Train with fun patterns or art pieces : 
10. Test on colorized videos we have done after we do our coloring : 
11. Once again reassemble video :
