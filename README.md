Neural network to colorize and use style transfer on grayscale images

To-Do List:
1. Download and prepare the dataset : DONE
2. Write code for extracting frames :  <br>
2.1 turn frames grayscale : 
3. Build CNN model with pytorch : 
4. Train CNN model with grayscale frames and compare with the original ground truth from these videos : 
5. Reassemble colored frames into a video : 
6. Attemp creating another NN for style transfer : 
7. Train with fun patterns or art pieces : 
8. Test on colorized videos we have done after we do our coloring : 
9. Once again reassemble video :
