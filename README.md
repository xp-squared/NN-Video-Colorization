Neural network to colorize and use style transfer on grayscale images

To Do:
1. Instead of extracting data from videos, lets use a dataset instead (making our own dataloader is very hard) : 
2. Train the model with dataset, maybe CIFAR-10 or ImageNET and we can load it with pytorch :
3. Make it where we can colorize a single image that we give (user input?) : 
4. Output color image into seprate folder? : 
5. Extract all frames from very short video to start off with colorize each frame and reassemble video : 
6. Work on style transfer :
