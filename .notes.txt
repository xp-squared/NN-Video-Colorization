Dataset we will use
- UCF-101 a large dataset of videos used for action recognition,
excellent for frame consistency because the dataset contains vids across many categories

- DAVIS Dataset, primarily used for segmentation but has high-quality annotated videos

We want to use a video dataset for frame coloring consistency

Directory where project is located: C:\Users\b4igo\Desktop\CompVis\NN-Video-Colorization>

We use virtual environment to make sure that these dependencies being used are specific to this project and not the system.
Activate VENV: venv\Scripts\activate

If a user wants to try and use my program and copy the dependencies they can do pip install -r requirements.txt

Remember I can run from top right corner but also can put these in vscode terminal: python dataset_utils.py
