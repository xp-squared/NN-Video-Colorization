Dataset we will use
- UCF-101 a large dataset of videos used for action recognition,
excellent for frame consistency because the dataset contains vids across many categories

- DAVIS Dataset, primarily used for segmentation but has high-quality annotated videos

We want to use a video dataset for frame coloring consistency

Directory where project is located: C:\Users\b4igo\Desktop\CompVis\NN-Video-Colorization>

We use virtual environment to make sure that these dependencies being used are specific to this project and not the system.
Activate VENV: venv\Scripts\activate

If a user wants to try and use my program and copy the dependencies they can do pip install -r requirements.txt

Remember I can run from top right corner but also can put these in vscode terminal: python dataset_utils.py


Problems occuring that happened when we left off:
- Can extract all the frames which is fantastic but I think we have too much data, maybe lessen the dataset by deleting some
- Going to take up more space by converting the ground truth to gray scale
- In extract frames send that current frame to another function turning that frame gray and storing it in another folder

I deleted some parts of the dataset to save space
-BoxingPunchingBag
-Fencing
-HammerThrow
-PlayingViolin
-PlayingSitar
-PlayingDhol
-PlayingDaf
-SkiJet
-ShavingBeard
-TaiChi
-PlayingTable


Convert images to grayscale as well I believe we need to resize the images
