Issues Encountered: 
-Originally was using UCF-101 Data set where I had converted all of it to frames and as well grayscale frames, had issues with some
videos having a black border around image so could mess with training
-When creating the final colored video I would not be able to show the video because I was resizing off of original frame dimensions and not resized dimensions

Training: 
-Og models trained thousands of epochs but steps were tiny
-Newer models have much larger steps, trained for 500 epochs
