Dataset we will use
- UCF-101 a large dataset of videos used for action recognition,
excellent for frame consistency because the dataset contains vids across many categories

Directory where project is located: "C:\Users\b4igo\Desktop\CompVis\NN-Video-Colorization"

We use virtual environment to make sure that these dependencies being used are specific to this project and not the system.
Activate VENV: venv\Scripts\activate, I activate in terminal for VS code

If a user wants to try and use my program and copy the dependencies they can do pip install -r requirements.txt

I deleted some parts of the dataset to save space
-BoxingPunchingBag
-Fencing
-HammerThrow
-PlayingViolin
-PlayingSitar
-PlayingDhol
-PlayingDaf
-SkiJet
-ShavingBeard
-TaiChi
-PlayingTable

Went 80/20 split on data
Training Set: This subset is used to train the model. It helps the model learn patterns from the data.
Testing Set: This set is used after the model is trained to assess its final performance. It's not used during the training process.

After training just test with those detroit images on reddit so we can just test that it is properly coloring an image first
before trying to stitch together a whole video again

As well after doing data loader we need to add loss function and backward propagation, related to step 4 in geek4geek link
